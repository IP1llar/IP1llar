# Full Stack Developer

Hi there! I’m a full stack developer with a strong background in **mathematics, system design, and scalable web applications**. I enjoy building projects that combine **complex logic, automation, and user-facing interfaces**.

## Key Technologies
TypeScript, Node.js, SQL/PostgreSQL, WebSockets, AWS, Docker, Playwright, Jest

## Highlighted Project
### Hackaranda
- A modular game sim platform, initially for the card game Arboretum  
- Includes **CLI tournament engine** for containerized bots using TypeScript  
- Hosted a weekend hackathon with 15 participants, enabling **multi-language bot integration via Docker**  
- Take a look at the **documentation and example bots** if you're interested and want to take part in the next one!  

## About Me
I’m always exploring new **technical challenges in web development, backend systems, and automation**, and I’m excited to contribute to projects that push boundaries.

I'm currently exploring Go, AWS, Docker, and Rust.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you want to **collaborate or discuss ideas**.
